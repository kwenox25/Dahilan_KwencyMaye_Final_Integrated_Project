# Quatro - Brand Refresh

For my latest project, I took on the challenge of refreshing the Quatro brand, a popular drink from the 80s that was famous in the UK. The main goal was to give the brand a new look and feel, and to create a series of responsive websites that would scale seamlessly across different devices.

To achieve this, I designed three websites: the index page, shop page, and contact page. The index page serves as the main landing page for the brand, providing an overview of its history and products.  I carefully curated the content and design elements to create an engaging and informative user experience.

The shop page, on the other hand, allows users to browse through Quatro's products without necessarily making any purchases. I designed it to be simple and user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to navigate through the available products.

Lastly, the contact page serves as a means for customers to get in touch with the brand. I made it simple and intuitive, featuring a contact form and relevant information such as the brand's address and phone number.
